# DDT_nanoparticle_distribution_in_zebrafish

ImageJ-generated dataset (.csv) of fluorescent confocal microscopy images of dorsal tail region of zebra fish embryo (2dpf). 
Embryos were injected with fluorescent anionic polystyrene nanoparticles (100 nm) or neutral liposome nanoparticles (100 nm), different fluorescence measurements were taken in imageJ:

- Total mean fluorescence
- Mean intravascular fluorescence
- Mean extravascular fluorescence
- Mean fluorescence in caudal vein
- Mean fluorescence in dorsal aorta

Differences between mean measurements of the 2 nanoparticle groups were analyzed statistically using Mann-Whitney u-test in Rstudio, contained in Rmarkdown file.

Part of project of the course "Drug Delivery Technology", third year course of the minor "Modern Drug Discovery" of "Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences (BSc) at Leiden University. 
December 2022.
